My source code is included in CG_hw4. It is written in Python and I included a shebang at
the top so that it could run in the way the professor preferred. All tests ran fine on Tux.

Extra Credit:
I did attempt the extra credit for this assignment. It works fine overall, but the caps are
colored black for smooth shaded.

Features:
My program takes in args -f, -u, -t, -F, -S and -C. They are optional and there are default
values set. It parses the given file for the given control points. Next, it will compute
the Catmull-Rom using the given num_u parameter. The program then computes the surface of
revolution using num_t. It then defines the triangles and computes the surface normal if 
specified. Finally, the program will print out the necessary points and data in the inventor 
format.

Surface Normals:
My surface normal calculations are done in the file CG_hw4. For the theta tangent, I have a 
function defined on line 153. For the u tangent, I compute the derivative of my Catmull-Rom
in the bezier function on line 116. I then get the u tangent by computing the surface of 
revolution of the derivative on line 239. Finally I take the cross product of the two
tangents on line 247.
